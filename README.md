Settler 3 Advanced Trainer

This is an old project I dug out, it allows you to do the following things:
  - Lose the game (very useful, still buggy)
  - Win the game (still buggy)
  - Unlimited Mana
  - Convert units to a different team
  - Convert units to a completely different type (yes, you can convert people into boats)
  - Make a unit invincible
  - Apply unit conversions to only one unit, only the selected units or every unit on the entire map

Things i was too lazy to implement so far:
  - Unit teleportation
  - English gui
  
 Things I havent figured out:
  - Change the type of buildings
  - Change ressource type and amount
